- Welcome to Clicks How-To Series.
- Today's video tutorial is about forking a chat.
- Example scenario: You're on a company support team and receive a customer ticket that needs a developer's help.
- Instead of adding the developer to the channel or explaining separately, you can fork a chat from the ticket.
- To fork a chat:
  1. Click on the three dots next to your message.
  2. Select "Fork from here."
  3. Add the required participants for the chat.
- This action creates an instant duplicate chat containing the conversation from the selected point.
