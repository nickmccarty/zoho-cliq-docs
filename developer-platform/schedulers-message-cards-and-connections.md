- Introduction to schedulers on Zoho Click Developer platform
  - Schedulers automate tasks on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
  - They are useful for sharing analytics, news updates, and reports.

- Creating a scheduler
  - Go to click.zoho.com and navigate to Bots and Tools.
  - Create a scheduler, name it (e.g., Tech News), and set the recurring period and time.
  - Save and edit code in the code editor.

- Example: Posting top 10 tech news from an API to a chat at 10 am daily
  - Use `invoke URL` task to connect with REST APIs.
  - Store API response in a variable (e.g., news).
  - Use `info` task for debugging and examining the API data structure.
  - Create a list to store news content.
  - Use a loop to extract titles and URLs from the API response.
  - Limit the loop to 10 articles.
  - Convert the list to a string and post it to a channel using `postChannel` task.

- Improving message presentation with message cards
  - Message cards make messages more attractive and well-presented.
  - Use the message builder at click.zoho.com/messagebuilder to customize messages.
  - Create a JSON structure for the message card with components like text, lists, tables, or images.

- Using authenticated connections for private APIs
  - Connections allow Click to access third-party app data.
  - Click supports default connections with many services and custom connections for others.
  - Example: Creating a connection with Todoist to post weekly tasks in a marketing channel.
  - Use `invoke URL` task with the connection to fetch tasks from Todoist.
  - Construct a message card with pending tasks and post it using `postChannel` task.
