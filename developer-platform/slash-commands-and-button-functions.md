- Slash commands are shortcuts in conversations on Click's developer platform.
- They can pull or push files in chat, trigger workflows, and perform actions.
- Example: Sharing a Google Drive spreadsheet directly in chat without leaving the conversation.
- To create a slash command:
  1. Create a connection with Google Drive using the connections component.
  2. Go to profile picture, click on "Bots and Tools," and select "Create Command."
  3. Enter the name for the command (e.g., `/gdrive_files`), hint, and access level.
  4. Click "Save and Edit Code" and delete the default code.
  5. Use the `invokeUrl` function to connect to Google Drive API.
  6. Create a map called `params` to include any required parameters for the API call.
  7. Use the connection created earlier to execute the API call.
  8. Use the `info` statement to check the returned data.
  9. Build a message card with buttons using the Message Builder.
     - `open.url` button to view the file on Google Drive.
     - `invoke.function` button to share the view link in chat.
 10. In the code, create a list of files and add each file as a slide in the message card.
 11. Replace placeholders with dynamic variables from the files list.
 12. Copy the JSON of the message card and paste it into the code, replacing the slide array with dynamic content.
 13. Return the response and save the function.
- To create a button function for sharing:
  1. Create a new function and set the type as button function (e.g., `gdrive_share`).
  2. Retrieve the chat ID where the button is executed.
  3. Invoke the connection to get details of an individual file using its ID from Google Drive API.
  4. Extract the `webviewLink` from the response body.
  5. Frame a message card with a button to view the document using Message Builder.
  6. Replace the URL in the message card with the variable containing `webviewLink`.
  7. Use `postToChat` task to post the link in chat, allowing other users to view it.
- By clicking "View," users can open documents in Google Drive; by clicking "Share," a message card with a view button is posted in chat.
- The video concludes by emphasizing how slash commands, buttons, and connections can be used in Click to share Google Drive files without leaving chat.
