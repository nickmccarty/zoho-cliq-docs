- Introduction to Zoho Click's low-code developer platform and its components.
- Developer platforms allow modification of software to fit specific needs and workflows.
- Low-code platforms require minimal coding knowledge, making development accessible to non-experts.
- Zoho Click's developer platform is efficient and user-friendly, balancing utility with ease of use.
- It integrates with third-party applications, automates tasks, and centralizes notifications.
- Zoho Click uses Deluge, a proprietary scripting language that is easy to learn and serverless.
- The platform is client-independent, working across various operating systems.
