- Connections
  - Connections integrate third-party services with Zoho Click using URL invocation tasks.
  - Users can create custom connections or use default connections (over 80 supported services).
  - Connections can be shared within an organization after authentication.
  - They help reduce app-switching, saving time and increasing productivity.

- Using a Default Service Connection (Google)
  - Example given of creating a connection to send Gmail from within Click.
  - Steps include creating a connection, authenticating, creating a slash command, and setting up a form to input email details.
  - A function is created to execute the sending of the email using base64 encoding and Gmail's REST API.

- Using a Custom Service Connection (To Doist)
  - Example given of connecting to To Doist to manage tasks from within Click.
  - Steps include creating an app in To Doist, setting up a custom service connection in Click, and authenticating.
  - A bot is created to add tasks, with a shortcut menu and a function to handle task addition.

- Extensions
  - Extensions are bundles of Click components that can be shared outside an organization via the marketplace.
  - Example given of bundling To Doist components into an extension.
  - Extensions can be edited or published to the Click marketplace.

- Conclusion
  - The webinar concludes with encouragement to subscribe to Zoho Click's YouTube channel for future access to the recorded session.
  - The presenter hopes the webinar has cleared doubts about connections and extensions.
