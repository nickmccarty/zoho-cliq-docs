- **Why Separate Space for External Communication is Needed**
  - As companies grow, the complexity of managing internal and external communications increases.
  - Initially, internal communication is manageable, but as external collaborations grow, control over data sharing becomes challenging.
  - There is a risk of data leaks when collaborating with external stakeholders like partners, vendors, and consultants.
  - A dedicated space for external collaboration can mitigate the risk of sensitive information being shared with competitors.

- **What is a Click Network?**
  - A Click Network is a dedicated space for collaborating with external business stakeholders.
  - It offers configurable permissions for secure and controlled external collaboration.
  - Click Networks differ from Click Organizations in terms of control and user participation.

- **Setting Up a Click Network**
  - To set up a network, you need an existing Click organization with an unlimited plan.
  - Steps include creating the network, customizing settings, managing policies, creating roles, adding members, and installing applications.

- **Creating Networks and Teams**
  - Admins or users with admin roles can create networks.
  - Networks can be created from the Click admin panel by entering required information and choosing options.
  - Admins can create teams and set joining modes (direct or request to join).
  - Users can also create teams based on permissions granted by the admin.

- **Collaboration in Networks**
  - Teams can create channels for group collaboration.
