- **Challenges in Remote Work:**
  - Many office workers desire the option to work remotely at least once a week.
  - Post-pandemic, there's an increase in fully remote companies and hybrid options.
  - Remote workers face burnout from digital communication tools, feelings of disconnection, security risks, and difficulty unplugging after work hours.
  - Downsides include miscommunication, less collaboration, no community feeling, non-adherence to timelines, fatigue, mental health issues, and less job satisfaction.

- **Objectives of Remote Managers:**
  - Focus on people management and work management.
  - Build trust with team members and understand their work styles.
  - Listen to understand, not just to respond.
  - Balance autocratic and participative leadership.
  - Accept mistakes and be open to change.

- **Unconscious Bias in Decision Making:**
  - Managers should be aware of biases like affinity bias, halo bias, confirmation bias, perception bias, and mob bias that can affect decision-making.

- **Handling Conflicts:**
  - Encourage objective thinking over subjective arguments.
  - Resolve conflicts by addressing the root issues.

- **Work Management:**
  - Clearly define roles and responsibilities.
  - Avoid micromanagement while ensuring accountability.
  - Use collaboration tools effectively (e.g., Zoho Click).
  - Apply productivity techniques like the Pomodoro Technique, time blocking, and the Eisenhower Matrix.

- **Zoho Click for Remote Work:**
  - Features like check-in/check-out buttons, status updates, call transfers between devices, and meeting scheduling can enhance remote work management.
  - The platform helps track who is working, away, or in meetings for better collaboration.

The webinar emphasizes the importance of understanding both the emotional well-being of team members and the practical aspects of managing work in a remote environment. It also highlights how tools like Zoho Click can support these efforts.
